# covidVacine_DataViz
This project required us to orchestrate data visualizations that analyze a specific problem. Following the guidelines outlined, we decided on tackling the racial disparities in the Covid-19 vaccine distributions and the correlation between poverty/race and covid cases. All data sets have been sourced from KFF, a non-profit data-aggregating organization that specializes in health issues. Covid-19 has disproportionately impacted minority groups throughout the U.S. At the same time, minority groups have been inadequately supported during the pandemic when compared to their white counterparts.


Make sure to download all the files and save the csv files in the same folder as the python file.
